.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
The GIPPtool utility \fBmseed2segy\fP gathers seismic data from one or more
recorders and integrates the traces into seismic sections. It supports the
creation of shot as well as receiver gathers. You can switch between the two
gather modes by specifying \f(CR\-\-shot\-gather\fP or \f(CR\-\-receiver\-gather\fP at the
command line. The option \f(CR\-\-segy\-format\fP is used to further specify the
output file format (SEG\-Y, Seismic Unix, ...).
.sp
To convert the recorded data into seismic sections, the program must know
about the setup of the experiment. This is done by providing a \fIproject file\fP
(command line option \f(CR\-\-project\fP) containing information about the location
of every shot and receiver point in the experiment as well as the times when
the receivers were actually recording, respectively when the sources were
triggered.
.sp
After parsing the project file, the program will next index the recorded
seismic data contained in the files and directories given at the command
line. This step is necessary so that the program later knows which of the
input files contain the traces required for writing the seismic section. If
a \fIdirectory\fP is given at the command line, the program searches recursively
for input files inside the directory. The search can be shortened to contain
only files matching a pattern given by the \f(CR\-\-include\-pattern\fP option. If
you plan to use this program repeatedly on the same dataset, you might also
consider saving the index to a file in between program runs (option
\f(CR\-\-index\-cache\fP).
.sp
After all the required information is available, the utility will begin to
prepare (internal) lists of time windows describing what data belongs into
the respective shot/receiver gather. This is usually done by taking the
trigger time of the seismic source and then looking\-up, which receivers were
actually recording at that time. However, you can further influence the
calculation of relevant time windows by applying a reduction velocity,
changing the trace length and/or setting a trace offset. (Please see
\f(CR\-\-reduction\-velocity\fP, \f(CR\-\-trace\-length\fP and \f(CR\-\-trace\-offset\fP options for
details.)
.sp
Finally, the information from the internal shot/receiver gather list are used
to look\-up the respective input files in the previously created index of the
available seismic data. The program then reads the necessary data snippets
from the input files, converts them to SEG\-Y or Seismic Unix format and
writes the resulting seismic sections to the current working directory or in
a separate directory (use option \f(CR\-\-output\-dir\fP).
.SH "OPTIONS"
.sp
The program pretty much follows expected Unix command line syntax. Some
command line options have two variants, one long and an additional short one
(for convenience). These are shown below, separated by commas. However, most
options only have a long variant. The \(oq\f(CR=\fP\(cq for options that take a
parameter is required and can not be replaced by a whitespace.

.RS 4
This option increases the amount of information given to the user during
program execution. By default, (i.e. without this option) \fBmseed2segy\fP only
reports warnings and errors. (See the diagnostics section below.)
.RE
.sp
\-\-include\-pattern=\fIPATTERN\fP
.RS 4
Only process files whose filename matches the given \fIPATTERN\fP. Files with
a name not matching the search \fIPATTERN\fP will be ignored. This option is
quite useful to speed up recursive searches through large subdirectory trees
and can be used more than once in the same command line.
.sp
You can use the two wild card characters (\f(CR*\fP and \f(CR?\fP) when specifying a
\fIPATTERN\fP (e.g. \f(CR*.pri?\fP). Or alternatively, you can also use a predefined
filter called \f(CRGIPP\fP that can be used to exclude all files not following the
usual GIPP naming convention for miniSEED files recorded by
\c
.URL "http://www.earthdata.co.uk" "Earth Data"
loggers (e.g. message logging or status files, see examples section below).

\-\-index\-cache=\fIFILE\fP
.RS 4
Enable caching of the (internal) input file index. Before this program
can write seismic sections it first must know which input files contains
the necessary traces. For that purpose an \fIindex\fP of all available input
files is build first. Unfortunately, since the content of all input files
must be scanned for the index, this can be a quiet time\-consuming process.
.sp
To avoid lengthy, repeated scans every time the program is started, the
\f(CR\-\-index\-cache\fP option can be used to cache the index of all input files
in a separate \fIFILE\fP.

It is the responsibility of the user to ensure that the cached
index is up\-to\-date and (still) corresponds to the files and
directories given as input at the command line. If in doubt,
simply delete the cache manually and let the utility generate
and save a new cache file during the next program run.
.sp .5v
.RE
.sp
If the cache \fIFILE\fP already exist the index will be read from it. If the
file does not exist (yet), the index will be saved to it after scanning
the input files. Already existing cache files will never be overwritten!
By default, (i.e. without this option) caching of the index is disabled.
.RE
.sp
\-\-output\-dir=\fIDIRECTORY\fP
.RS 4
Save the resulting seismic sections to this \fIDIRECTORY\fP. The directory must
already exist and be writable! Already existing files in that directory will
not be overwritten unless the option \f(CR\-\-force\-overwrite\fP is used as well.
.RE
.sp
\-\-force\-overwrite
.RS 4
If this option is used, already existing files in the output directory
will be overwritten without mercy!
.sp
The default behavior however is \fBnot\fP to overwrite already existing files.
Instead, a new file is created with an additional number in between filename
and extension.
.RE
.sp
\-\-force\-concat
.RS 4
Use this option to concatenate all resulting shot/receiver gathers into
a single file. This can be useful if you plan to import the gathers into
other software packages for further processing. (You only need to import
one single file instead of many files.)
.sp
By default, however, a new output file is created for every single gather
created.

\-\-shot\-gather=\fIFFIDs\fP
.RS 4
The resulting seismic sections are organized as shot gather. If no \fIFFID\fP
range is specified, the program will try to write a seismic section for
every FFID found in the projects (geometry) configuration file (see project
file section below).
.sp
Alternatively, you can also specify a comma separated list of single FFIDs
or ranges of FFIDs. Use two dots between the first and last FFID to specify
a range. Please note that FFID lists and ranges must not contain any space
characters!
.sp
Example: To produce seismic sections of the shots with FFID 1, 4, 5 and
6 you could use \f(CR\-\-shot\-gather=1,4..6\fP.
.RE
.sp
\-\-receiver\-gather=\fICHANNELS\fP
.RS 4
The resulting seismic sections are organized as receiver gather. If no
\fICHANNEL\fP range is given, the program will try to write a seismic section
for every channel found in the projects (geometry) configuration file (see
project file section below).
.sp
Alternatively, you can also specify a comma separated list of single channels
or ranges of channels. Use two dots between the first and last channel to
specify a range. Please note that channel lists and ranges must not contain
any space characters!
.sp
Example: To produce seismic sections for receivers with the channel ids
10, 11, 24, 25 and 26 you would use \f(CR\-\-receiver\-gather=10,11,24..26\fP.
.RE
.sp
\-\-trace\-length=\fIDURATION\fP
.RS 4
Length of the traces in the resulting seismic section. The \fIDURATION\fP is
given in seconds. Fractions of seconds will be rounded to microsecond
accuracy. If there are not enough samples in the input, the trace in the
seismic section will be padded. The default trace length is one minute.
.sp
Example: Use \f(CR\-\-trace\-length=120\fP to obtain two minute long seismic
sections consisting of 12000 samples per trace (assuming input data
recorded at 100 Hz). To produce 12001 samples per trace you would use
\f(CR\-\-trace\-length=120.01\fP as command line option.
.RE
.sp
\-\-trace\-offset=\fISHIFT\fP
.RS 4
Use this option to shift the start time of the traces in the seismic section
relative to the trigger time of the shot (as read from the project file).
The \fISHIFT\fP is given in seconds. If no time offset is given, the program will
default to begin the trace as close as possible to shot time.
.sp
Example: To start the seismic section 2 seconds before the shot time use
\f(CR\-\-trace\-offset=\-2\fP. (Note the minus sign! No spaces!)
.RE
.sp
\-\-reduction\-velocity=\fIVELOCITY\fP
.RS 4
Add a time delay proportional to the distance between source and receiver to
every trace in the seismic section. This factor, more commonly known as
reduction velocity, is given in meters per second. By default, no reduction
velocity is applied.
.sp
The distance between source and receiver point is calculated using the
coordinates in the project file (see project file section below). Obviously,
applying a reduction velocity must fail If the project file only contains
dummy/placeholder coordinates!
.RE
.SH "PROJECT FILE"
.sp
A project file plays an important role when building shot or receiver
gathers as it contains a description of experiment setup. Chiefly, these
are geographic locations as well as time information.
.sp
Project files are simple text files where every (non\-comment) line represents
one source or receiver point of the experiment. The general syntax rules are:
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04' 1.\h'+01'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.  sp -1
.  IP " 1." 4.2
.\}
Everything from a \f(CR#\fP character up to the end of line is considered to be
a comment (and will be ignored by the program).
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04' 2.\h'+01'\c
.\}
.el \{\

.RS 4
.ie n \{\

.el \{\

Any sequence of space characters or tab\-stops in a line containing (any)
text will be interpreted as column separator! The use of spaces inside
(column) strings is not supported.
.RE
.sp
The number and content of the different columns varies. Lines describing
seismic sources ("shots") will e.g. contain the location and trigger time
of the source. Receiver lines, however, describe where and when the
recorders were operating. The following listing is an example describing
three blasts (the "seismic sources") carried out during an experiment in
South Africa.

.SH "ENVIRONMENT"
.sp
The following environment variables can optionally be used to influence
the behavior of the GIPPtool utilities.
.sp
GIPPTOOLS_HOME
.RS 4
This environment variable is used to find the location of the GIPPtools
installation directory. In particular, the Java class files that make up the
GIPPtools are expected to be in the \f(CRjava\fP subdirectory of \fBGIPPTOOLS_HOME\fP.
.RE
.sp
GIPPTOOLS_JAVA
.RS 4
The utilities of the GIPPtools are written in the programming language Java
and consequently need a Java Runtime Environment (JRE) to execute. Use this
variable to specify the location of the JRE which should be used.
.RE
.sp
GIPPTOOLS_OPTS
.RS 4
You can use this environment variable for additional fine\-tuning of the
Java runtime environment. This is typically used to set the Java heap size
available to GIPPtool programs.
.RE
.sp
It is usually not necessary to define any of those variables as suitable
values should be selected automatically. However, if the automatic detection
build into the start script fails, or you need to choose between different
GIPPtool or Java runtime releases installed on your computer, these
environment variables might become quite helpful to troubleshoot the
situation.
.SH "DIAGNOSTICS"
.sp
Occasionally, the \fBmseed2segy\fP utility will produce user feedback. In general,
user messages are classified as \fIINFO\fP, \fIWARNING\fP or \fIERROR\fP. The \fIINFO\fP
messages are only displayed when the \f(CR\-\-verbose\fP command line option is used.
They usually report about the progress of the program run, give statistical
information or write a final summary.
.sp
More important are \fIWARNING\fP messages. In general, they warn about (possible)
issues that may influence the outcome. Although the program will continue
with execution, you certainly should check the results carefully. You might
not have gotten what you (thought you) asked for. Finally, \fIERROR\fP messages
inform about problems that can not be resolved automatically. Program
execution usually stops and the user must fix the cause of the error first.
.SH "EXIT CODES"
.sp
Use the following program exit codes when calling \fBmseed2segy\fP from scripts
or other programs to see if \fBmseed2segy\fP finished successfully. Any non\-zero
code indicates an \fIERROR\fP!
